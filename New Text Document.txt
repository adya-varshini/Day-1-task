1) Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP/1.1 -- works on textual format
         -- there is a head of line blocking that blocks all the request behind it until it doesn't get its all resources.
         -- it uses requests resource inlining for use getting multiple pages.
         -- it compresses data by itself
HTTP/2 -- it works on the binary protocol
       -- it allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for 
          multiple requests.
      -- it uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
      -- it uses HPACK(which is used to split data from header) for data compression.

2) Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

- objects are important data types in javascript
- it can hold many values in the form of key:value pair.
- these keys can be variables or functions and are called as properties and 
  methods.
- every object has some property asssociated with some value.
- after the creation of the object , the value inside the object can be 
  accessed using keys.
- syntax for adding a property to an object:
  ObjectName.ObjectProperty=propertyValue;
- object method is an object property containing a function definition.
- javascript object can be created with - object literal,
                                        - constructor,
                                        - keyword new,
                                        - Object.create method

3) Read about IP address, port, HTTP methods, MAC address	

IP address== intrenet protocol address is a unique numerical identifier for every device or network that connects to the internet.
- typically assigned by an internet service provider(ISP) , an IP address is an online device address used for communicating across the internet.
- Each internet protocol address can send information to other IP addresses through discrete chunks known as packets.
- Each network packet contains the data being transferred along with a header containing the metadata of the packet.


port== is a physical docking point using which an external device can be connected to the computer.
- It can also be programmatic docking point through which information flows from a program to the computer or over the Internet.
- external devices are connected to a computer using cables and ports.
- Ports are slots on the motherboard into which a cable of external device is plugged in.
- Ex of external devices attached via ports are the mouse, keyboard, monitor, microphone, speakers, etc


HTTP methods== -GET
               -POST
               -PUT
               -HEAD
               -DELETE
               -PATCH
               -OPTIONS
               -CONNECT
               -TRACE
- GET: 
The GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data.
- HEAD :
transfers the status line and header section only.
- POST :
A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms.
- PUT :
Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.
- DELETE :
Removes all current representations of the target resource given by a URI.
- CONNECT :
Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by a given URI.
- OPTIONS :
Describes the communication options for the target resource.
- TRACE :
Performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.


MAC address== A MAC address, which stands for Media Access Control Address, is a physical address that works at the Data Link Layer. 
- MAC Addresses are unique 48-bit hardware number of a computer, that is embedded into a network card (known as a Network Interface Card during manufacturing.
- The MAC Address is also known as the Physical Address of a network device.
